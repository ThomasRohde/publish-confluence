# Migration Complete: Vite/Rollup to esbuild

## Overview

The `publish-confluence` project has been successfully migrated from Vite/Rollup to esbuild as outlined in the migration plan.

## What Changed

1. **Build System**
   - Replaced Vite/Rollup with esbuild for all bundling
   - Created dedicated build scripts for the library and CLI
   - Improved handling of the CLI shebang line
   - Added proper source map generation

2. **TypeScript Configuration**
   - Updated tsconfig.json for better compatibility with esbuild
   - Added separate type declaration generation

3. **Dependencies**
   - Removed unnecessary Vite/Rollup dependencies
   - Added esbuild-node-externals for handling external packages

4. **Build Scripts**
   - Created a unified build.js script to orchestrate the build process
   - Created a specialized build-cli.js script for proper CLI handling
   - Updated bundle-template-scripts.js to work with the new build system

5. **Validation**
   - Created a check-esbuild-migration.js script to verify the migration

## Benefits Achieved

✅ **Simplified Build Process**: Reduced complexity by using fewer tools
✅ **Faster Builds**: esbuild is significantly faster than Vite/Rollup
✅ **Better Match for Project Type**: Pure Node.js tools for a Node.js CLI project
✅ **Reduced Dependencies**: Fewer dependencies means less maintenance burden
✅ **Consistent Tooling**: Using esbuild for all bundling needs

## Testing Results

- All TypeScript files compile successfully
- CLI works properly with shebang line preserved
- All templates and assets are properly copied
- Type definitions are correctly generated
- Source maps are properly generated

## Next Steps

- [Optional] Implement watch mode for development
- [Optional] Add integration tests to verify the build output
- [Optional] Consider adding bundling for web-compatible modules

## Migration Completed

Migration from Vite/Rollup to esbuild is now complete. The project builds correctly and all functionality is preserved.
