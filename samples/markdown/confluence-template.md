```python
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, Aer, execute
from qiskit.visualization import plot_histogram
import numpy as np

def quantum_monte_carlo(iterations, dimension, function):
    # Set up quantum circuit
    qc = QuantumCircuit(dimension*2, dimension)
    
    # Apply Hadamard gates to create superposition
    for i in range(dimension):
        qc.h(i)
    
    # Apply function evaluation (problem specific)
    # [...implementation details...]
    
    # Measure results
    qc.measure(range(dimension), range(dimension))
    
    # Execute and collect results
    simulator = Aer.get_backend('qasm_simulator')
    job = execute(qc, simulator, shots=iterations)
    result = job.result()

```

{{#confluence-tab name="Portfolio Optimization" icon="icon-sp-star"}}

### Portfolio Optimization

Quantum algorithms can potentially solve complex portfolio optimization problems more efficiently:

- **Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO)** models can be mapped to quantum systems
- **Markowitz Portfolio Theory** implementation with quantum advantage for large asset pools
- **Multi-period Rebalancing** strategies optimized through quantum annealing or gate-based approaches
- **Constraints Satisfaction** for complex regulatory and client requirements

{{confluence-status type="blue" text="Active Research"}}

Traditional portfolio optimization requires solving quadratic programming problems that grow exponentially in complexity with the number of assets. Quantum approaches using either:

1. **Quantum Annealing** (e.g., D-Wave systems)
2. **Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA)**
3. **Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE)**

Can theoretically provide significant speedups for portfolios with hundreds or thousands of assets.

### Fraud Detection & Security

Quantum computing offers both challenges and opportunities for banking security:

- **Quantum Machine Learning** for anomaly detection with higher accuracy
- **Pattern Recognition** in transaction data revealing previously undetectable fraud
- **Post-Quantum Cryptography** preparation for quantum threat to current encryption
- **Secure Multi-party Computation** enhanced by quantum protocols

{{confluence-status type="yellow" text="Urgent Preparation Needed"}}

{{#confluence-warning title="Cryptographic Vulnerability" comment=false}}

Shor's algorithm running on a sufficiently powerful quantum computer could break RSA and ECC encryption, which secures most banking transactions today. Financial institutions should prepare migration paths to post-quantum cryptographic standards.

{{/confluence-warning}}

NIST has selected several post-quantum cryptographic algorithms that banks should begin evaluating:
- CRYSTALS-Kyber (key establishment)
- CRYSTALS-Dilithium (digital signatures)
- FALCON (digital signatures)
- SPHINCS+ (digital signatures)
