**Setting**: `setting(chat.instructionsFilesLocations)`

Instructions files (also known as custom instructions or rules) provide a way to describe common guidelines and context for the AI model in a Markdown file, such as code style rules, or which frameworks to use. Instructions files are not standalone chat requests, but rather provide context that you can apply to a chat request.

Instructions files use the `.instructions.md` file suffix. They can be located in your user data folder or in the workspace. The `setting(chat.instructionsFilesLocations)` setting lists the folders that contain instruction files.

You can manually attach instructions to a specific chat request, or they can be automatically added:

* To add them manually, use the **Add Context** button in the Chat view, and then select **Instructions...**.
  Alternatively use the **Chat: Attach Instructions...** command from the Command Palette. This brings up a picker that lets you select existing instructions files or create a new one to attach.

* To automatically add instructions to a prompt, add the `applyTo` Front Matter header to the instructions file to indicate which files the instructions apply to. If a chat request contains a file that matches the given glob pattern, the instructions file is automatically attached.

  The following example provides instructions for TypeScript files (`applyTo: '**/*.ts'`):

  ````md
  ---
  applyTo: '**/*.ts'
  ---
  Place curly braces on separate lines for multi-line blocks:
  if (condition)
  {
    doSomething();
  }
  else
  {
    doSomethingElse();
  }
  ````

You can create instruction files with the **Chat: New Instructions File...** command. Moreover, the files created in the _user data_ folder can be automatically synchronized across multiple user machines through the Settings Sync service. Make sure to check the **Prompts and Instructions** option in the **Backup and Sync Settings...** dialog.

#### Prompt files

**Setting**: `setting(chat.promptFilesLocations)`

Prompt files describe a standalone, complete chat request, including the prompt text, chat mode, and tools to use. Prompt files are useful for creating reusable chat requests for common tasks. For example, you can add a prompt file for creating a front-end component, or to perform a security review.

Prompt files use the `.prompt.md` file suffix. They can be located in your user data folder or in the workspace. The `setting(chat.promptFilesLocations)` setting lists the folder where prompt files are looked for.

There are several ways to run a prompt file:

* Type `/` in the chat input field, followed by the prompt file name.

* Open the prompt file in an editor and press the 'Play' button in the editor tool bar. This enables you to quickly iterate on the prompt and run it without having to switch back to the Chat view.

* Use the **Chat: Run Prompt File...** command from the Command Palette.

Prompt files can have the following Front Matter metadata headers to indicate how they should be run:

* `mode`: the chat mode to use when invoking the prompt (`ask`, `edit`, or `agent` mode).
* `tools`: if the `mode` is `agent`, the list of tools that are available for the prompt.

The following example shows a prompt file for generating release notes, that runs in agent mode, and can use a set of tools:

```md
---
mode: 'agent'
tools: ['getCurrentMilestone', 'getReleaseFeatures', 'file_search', 'semantic_search', 'read_file', 'insert_edit_into_file', 'create_file', 'replace_string_in_file', 'fetch_webpage', 'vscode_search_extensions_internal']
---
Generate release notes for the features I worked in the current release and update them in the release notes file. Use [release notes writing instructions file](.github/instructions/release-notes-writing.instructions.md) as a guide.
```

To create a prompt file, use the **Chat: New Prompt File...** command from the Command Palette.

#### Improvements and notes

* Instructions and prompt files now have their own language IDs, configurable in the _language mode_ dialog for any file open document ("Prompt" and "Instructions" respectively). This allows, for instance, using untitled documents as temporary prompt files before saving them as files to disk.
* We renamed the **Chat: Use Prompt** command to **Chat: Run Prompt**. Furthermore, the command now runs the selected prompt _immediately_, as opposed to attaching it as chat context as it did before.
* Both file types now also support the `description` metadata in their headers, providing a common place for short and user-friendly prompt summaries. In the future, this header is planned to be used along with the `applyTo` header as the rule that determines if the file needs to be auto-included with chat requests (for example, `description: 'Code style rules for front-end components written in TypeScript.'`)
